# Web3.bio 
## One link for your Web3 profile.

Web3.bio is a NEAR powered portal for your Web3 and Web 2.0 profiles - social accounts, blockchain addresses/crypto name services and NFT collections. We're helping Web3-native adopters, buidlers, NFT collectors, and teams better control their universal Web3 identities online.

## Scenarios

By creating a Web3.bio page, you can link to all your pages — DApp links, social accounts, blockchain addresses, NFT avatars/collections, crypto things — making it easier for your audiences to discover and action.

1. Web3/crypto native influencers and teams can combine all profiles on one page. Share it anywhere, especially on platforms, like Twitter, which only allow for one link. 
2. Web3 buidlers can get one-time sponsored/paid by crypto methods to their addresses. Recurring payment is planned in a future update. It is fun and friendly to fund your creative works or get subscribed by your audiences.
3. Web3.bio initially supports NEAR accounts. Both ENS and other name services, blockchains importing supports are planned. Web3.bio will open up its own name system for auction.
